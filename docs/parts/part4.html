            In this final exercise, you will create a dictionary that associates Employees with their integer IDs.
            To complete the exercise, you will perform the following steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a <code>Dictionary</code> to map from <code>int</code> to <code>Employee</code>.</li>
            <li>Add three employees using the IDs 101, 102 and 103 to the dictionary.</li>
            <li>Pull each employee out of the dictionary by the ID.</li>
            <li>Display each employee in the console.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When your are finished, your application will look like:</p>
        <img src="./res/images/completed-lab4.PNG" />

        <h2>Required Assets</h2>
        <p>
            The provided <strong>Resources</strong> folder for this part contains a subfolder named <strong>Start</strong> with a solution
            you will use as starter code. The <strong>Completed</strong> subfolder contains a completed project you can use to check your work.
        </p>

            Try to use the picture and above steps to complete the lab exercise using the starter project, referring to the slides if you need
            any help in creating the bank account application. You can also use the following step-by-step instructions to fill in any knowledge gaps.
            There are <code>TODO</code> comment markers where you will add code.
        </p>

        <h2>Define a Dictionary to hold employees</h2>
        <p>
            You need to hold a group of employees and be able to look them up quickly using their employee ID.
            While you could use a <code>List</code> or array, neither provides the "lookup by ID" feature so you would have to <em>search</em>
            to find each employee which is inefficient. Instead, you will use a <code>Dictionary</code> which provides faster lookup without the need to search.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Open the <b>EmployeeDictionary.sln</b> solution from the <b>Resources/Start</b> folder.
                This project has the <code>Employee</code> definition.
            </li>

            <li>
                Open the <b>Program.cs</b> file in the <b>EmployeeDictionary</b> project.
                It has some existing code and a set of <code>TODO</code> comments where you will add some code.
            </li>

            <li>
                After the first <code>TODO</code> comment, create a Dictionary that maps from <code>int</code> to <code>Employee</code>.
                Remember this is defined as <code>Dictionary&lt;int,Employee&gt;</code>. Name it <code>employeeDictionary</code>.
            </li>
            <p>
                <a href="#" onclick="toggleCode(this,'dictionary');return false;" class="uiitem">Show Code</a>
                <div class="indent-large" id="dictionary" style="display:none;">
<pre class="prettyprint">
// TODO: create a Dictionary from int to Employee
Dictionary&lt;int,Employee> employeeDictionary = new Dictionary&lt;int,Employee>();
</pre>
                </div>
            </p>

            <li>
                Add three employees using the integer IDs 101, 102 and 103 to the dictionary, For example, here is one created and using the ID 101:
            </li>
<pre class="codeblock prettyprint">
// TODO: Add an employee with an id of 101 to the dictionary
employeeDictionary.Add( 101,
  new Employee {
      Id = 101,
      FirstName = "Jesse",
      LastName = "Liberty",
  } );
</pre>
            <li>
                Next, index into the dictionary using the Id to get each employee and then print them into the console.
            </li>

            <li>
                Run the application to see the results!
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>
            In this lab exercise, you created a dictionary mapping an integer ID to an employee object, added three employee,
            and then printed them into the console.
        </p>
